# **Team Profile Generator**

## **Description**
---
Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application which accepts information on employees within a software engineering team and creates an HTML page which displays summaries for each employee.

A sample HTML file can be viewed [here](https://coderbennett.github.io/team-profile-generator/) to see what the final generated HTML file would look like.

## **Installation**
---
To properly install all modules for this app, make sure to run the `npm install` command while inside the main directory (team-profile-generator).

## **Usage**
---
To use the app, you will need to open your console or terminal and navigate to the main directory (team-profile-generator).

Once inside the main directory you just need to use the `node index.js` command to begin the app!

From this point forward you will be prompted with questions about your team members. You will first need to fill out responses to questions on the manager of the team. Once the manager's details are completed you will be able to add either engineers or interns to your team.

Once you have added all the team members you would like, you can select to finish the team builder and create the page! This all can be seen in the walkthrough video linked below:

## **Credits**
---
This app was authored by [coderbennett](https://github.com/coderbennett). I am a full stack web dev making projects like this to expand my knowledge of Node.js and many other skills needed to build something like this. If you would like to contact me you can reach me [here](mailto:coderbennett1@gmail.com).

I also would not have been able to do this project without the technologies I mentioned in the above [tech](#technologies) section. Lately daisyUI has been my goto for CSS components, and Tailwind is a great framework to work with. The Node packages inquirer and jest also do a lot of the heavy lifting for this project.
